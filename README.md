# Adversarial Code Review

A Claude Code **plugin** for advisory, **criticality-aware** code review. It understands a change's intent, scales review depth to risk (a typo gets a tiny review; an auth/payment/migration change gets adversarial depth), **adversarially verifies the findings it isn't sure about**, learns per project, and delivers results as Markdown, **HTML**, inline PR comments, or a pass/block gate.

**It never modifies your code — strictly advisory.**

> **New here?** [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) is a diagram-driven walkthrough of how a change flows through the plugin — built for readers who've never seen the code.

## What it does

- **Triages by risk** — deterministic, zero-cost tier selection (trivial → critical); cheap models classify, expensive models review only where the cost-of-miss is high.
- **Reviews the latest pushed code** — runs in a throwaway **git worktree** checked out from the remote's latest base/head, so it never reviews a stale local checkout; the worktree name is recorded in the report (`--no-worktree` to review the local tree instead). If the head is **behind its base**, it lists the missing commits and asks you to rebase/merge first (advisory — you can proceed) so the diff isn't computed against a stale base.
- **Understands intent both ways** — builds acceptance criteria from the PR, **existing PR comments**, commits, and **ClickUp/Jira** tickets (fetched **via MCP — no API tokens**); derives what the code actually does; flags where the two diverge.
- **Groups changes by intent** — separates the primary intent from **extra/unexplained changes** and scrutinizes the extras (scope-creep control).
- **Reviews every dimension** — 17 dimensions (correctness, security, tests, concurrency, perf, DB/migrations, API-compat, types, deps/CVE, observability, a11y, …), each a dedicated bundled agent, dispatched only when the change warrants it.
- **Runs real tools** — `npm audit` / `pip-audit` feed the dependency dimension.
- **Verify-all on non-trivial tiers** — on every tier where `plan.runVerify` is true, **every finding gets its own dedicated verification agent** (not just uncertain ones). Each verifier attacks from a **dimension-appropriate lens** (security→taint, concurrency→interleaving, …). Confirmed → kept; refuted → dropped; a **critical/important finding is not dropped on a single refuter** (when escalation is enabled and a 2nd look is affordable, a lone refutation → needs-human); a still-split result is surfaced to you, never silently dropped. Cap: **≤ 3 looks and ≤ 3 subagents per aspect**, enforced in code. (Trivial/low tiers skip the verify pass — the cost trade-off.)
- **Exhaustive mode** (`--exhaustive`, auto at `critical`) — opt-in ultrareview-parity passes that trade tokens for fewer misses: a **completeness critic** (what dimension/criterion/taint did we miss?), **generative verify** (a verifier may surface an adjacent finding, not just refute), a **taint/data-flow** verifier for security findings, and **loop-until-dry** re-sweeps. Off by default so normal reviews stay cheap.
- **Scales to large diffs** — shards a big change into coherent review units; no nested-agent sprawl.
- **Remembers** — per-project memory suppresses accepted false-positives, tags recurring findings, and stores open questions so it doesn't re-ask.
- **Asks when unsure** — material business-logic ambiguities become questions for you (saved to memory), not silent assumptions.

## Requirements

| Tool | Required? | Used for |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Node.js ≥ 18** (20+ recommended) | yes | the pure planning/render/verify scripts (zero npm deps) |
| **git** | yes | computing the diff |
| **a git remote** (e.g. `origin`) | optional | worktree review of the remote's latest base/head; without one it reviews the local checkout (`--no-worktree`) |
| **gh** (GitHub CLI) | optional | PR body + existing comments, and `--comment` (inline PR comments) |
| **ClickUp / Atlassian MCP** | optional | pull linked ticket context — **via MCP, no API tokens** |
| **npm / pip-audit** | optional | dependency/CVE scan (D15) |

`/review-init` runs a preflight that checks this and tells you what's missing.

## Install

Self-contained Claude Code plugin **and** a one-plugin marketplace. The repo *is* the
marketplace — add it by its GitHub slug, then install the plugin from it.

```text
/plugin marketplace add Tahmid12Khan/agentic-workflows     # GitHub slug (or a local path)
/plugin install adversarial-code-review@adversarial-code-review     # plugin@marketplace
```

Claude Code clones the repo, reads `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (which registers the
`adversarial-code-review` marketplace), and installs the bundled `adversarial-code-review`
plugin. The `/review-init` and `/review` commands are then available.

### Updating

Pull the latest version by refreshing the marketplace — this re-fetches the repo:

```text
/plugin marketplace update adversarial-code-review
```

The installed plugin then picks up the new version. If it doesn't, reinstall it (or manage
everything from the interactive `/plugin` menu):

```text
/plugin install adversarial-code-review@adversarial-code-review
```

## Quickstart

```text
/review-init     # check env + scaffold .adverserial-code-review/config.json
/review          # review the current branch vs its merge-base; writes review.md + review.html into .adverserial-code-review/review-<date>/review-<n>/
```

`/review` flags:

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--base <ref>` | Compare against `<ref>` instead of the auto-detected merge-base. |
| `--gate` | Exit non-zero on a `BLOCK` verdict (git hooks / CI). |
| `--comment` | Post confidence ≥ 80 findings as inline PR comments (needs `gh`). |
| `--tier <t>` | Force a tier (`trivial`…`critical`). |
| `--dimensions D2,D3` | Restrict to specific dimensions. |
| `--incremental` | Only re-spend effort on code new since the last review. |
| `--exhaustive` | Force the Tier C ultrareview-parity passes (completeness critic, taint, generative verify, loop-until-dry) at any tier. Costs more tokens; auto-on at `critical`. |
| `--no-worktree` | Review the local working tree instead of a worktree of the remote's latest base/head (use for **uncommitted** local changes). |

## The review output

Every run writes a self-contained report. Here is the HTML report for a `high`-tier PR review:

![Example HTML review report](docs/assets/review-example.png)

It opens with the tier + verdict, the PR number and start/finish timestamps, then the
requirement-traceability matrix (each row named, not just `AC1`), the findings grouped by
severity, the **Needs your input** questions, and an **Agents & coverage** rundown of
which agents ran (model + run count) and which did not and why.

### Where reviews are kept

Each run gets its own folder — an outer folder per day, an inner folder per run:

```
.adverserial-code-review/
  review-2026-06-21/                 # outer: the review date (YYYY-MM-DD)
    review-1-pr-128/                  # inner: run counter + PR number
      review.md                      # Markdown report
      review.html                    # same report, self-contained styled HTML
    review-2/                        # no open PR → the -pr-<n> suffix is omitted
      review.md
      review.html
```

The counter resets each day. The base folder (`.adverserial-code-review/`) also holds the
tracked `config.json`; the generated `review-*` folders, `learnings.json`, and
`last-review.json` are git-ignored.

### Format & how to access

- **`review.html`** — a single self-contained file (inline CSS, no assets). Open it in any
  browser: `open .adverserial-code-review/review-*/review-*/review.html` (macOS) or just
  double-click it. Best for reading.
- **`review.md`** — the same content as Markdown. Renders inline on GitHub/GitLab or in any
  editor; good for diffs, PR descriptions, and grepping.

Both files carry identical findings; pick whichever fits your workflow. The terminal also
prints the folder path, a one-line summary, and the verdict (`APPROVE` / `WARN` / `BLOCK`).

## How it works

```
INTAKE → CONTEXT → TRIAGE → [Workflow: INTENT → REVIEW (fan-out) → VERIFY (unsure findings) → SYNTHESIZE] → REPORT
preflight  gather    plan                harvest/    reviewers         separate agent             rollup       report.mjs
+worktree  +memory                       group/biz   (shard-scoped)    per unsure finding (≤3)                 /gate/comments
+scan
```

`/review` is a **thin dispatcher**: it runs the deterministic scripts (steps 1–3), then hands the fan-out to a Workflow (`lib/review-workflow.mjs`). The main agent never assembles report payloads by hand.

1. **Preflight + worktree** — verify node/git (gh, scanners optional); then, unless `--no-worktree`, `worktree.mjs` fetches the PR's base + head from the remote and checks out a throwaway git worktree at the **latest pushed** head — the review reads code and computes the diff there, then the worktree is removed (its name is recorded in the report). If the head is behind its base, it flags the missing commits and asks you to rebase/merge before reviewing.
2. **Context** — `gather.mjs` pulls PR body, **existing comments**, commits, and ClickUp/Jira **issue keys** (the tickets are then fetched **via MCP — no API tokens**); `memory.mjs` loads prior learnings; `scan.mjs` runs dependency CVE scans.
3. **Triage** (`plan.mjs` + `triage.mjs`) — diff → signals → tier, dimensions, per-dim model, **shards**, and the verification/escalation budgets. (The `triage-classifier` judgment pass runs at the start of the Workflow — see below.)
4. **Workflow fan-out** (`lib/review-workflow.mjs`) — the Workflow owns intent → review → verify → synthesize, then returns the assembled report **payload** (it does not render — the sandbox can't write files):
   - **Intent** — `triage-classifier` (haiku, skipped on the trivial tier) first sanity-checks the tier (raises it for the human when blast radius warrants, and **adds dimensions the rules missed** as real review aspects); then `intent-harvester` (stated vs derived + mismatches), `intent-grouper` (primary vs extra intents), `business-logic-analyzer` (assumptions + open questions).
   - **Review** — `correctness-reviewer` always; the planned specialist agents per dimension; one pass per shard for large diffs. Each reviewer gets a **diff scoped to its shard files** (D3/security keeps the full diff so cross-file taint survives; reviewers can Read/Grep for sibling context); extra-intent groups get focused scrutiny.
   - **Verify (the unsure findings)** — on non-trivial tiers (`plan.runVerify` true), the **unsure** findings — low-confidence, flagged uncertain, or high-severity on a risk path (`selectForVerification`) — each get their own verification agent; confident, non-risk findings are trusted and ship at the ≥80 gate. A separate `finding-verifier` (or `taint-verifier` for D3 security) adversarially tries to refute each selected finding. Cap: **≤ 3 looks and ≤ 3 subagents per aspect**; findings still-split → "needs human". On **exhaustive** reviews, a `completeness-critic` then hunts for what was **missed** (unrun dimension, uncovered criterion, untraced taint) and re-dispatches ≤ 6 targeted reviewers whose new findings re-enter Verify (all of them, for max rigor).
   - **Synthesize** — `review-synthesizer` dedupes, builds the requirement→code matrix, separates findings from open questions, emits a verdict.
5. **Deliver** — the main agent runs `report.mjs` directly on the returned payload (no executor agent), writing `review.md` + `review.html` into a per-run folder `.adverserial-code-review/review-<YYYY-MM-DD>/review-<n>[-pr-<num>]/` + a terminal summary. The report **always** includes an "Agents & coverage" section listing which agents ran and which did not (and why); `report.mjs` takes no `--out`/`--html` flags. Then it relays `folderPath` + verdict + `notes`; `--gate` → exit code; `--comment` → inline comments via `comments.mjs`; records this run to memory; surfaces open questions to you.

### Tiers (the token-saving brain)

| Tier | Example | Review |
|------|---------|--------|
| Trivial | typo, comment, doc | one quick inline pass, no subagents |
| Low | small localized logic w/ tests | one reviewer |
| Standard | normal feature/bugfix | correctness + screens + simplify |
| High | shared lib, API contract, perf hot path | full fan-out + bounded verify |
| Critical | auth, payments, migrations, concurrency, crypto | all dimensions, deepest models, bounded verify |

`risk_map` and `mandatory_checks` in `.adverserial-code-review/config.json` are **floors** triage cannot skip.

### Bounded adversarial verification

Runs on **high/critical tiers** (lower tiers ship at the ≥80 gate). The user-tunable contract: re-check **only the aspects a reviewer was unsure about** — never the whole review — and look at any one aspect **at most 3 times** (1 review + ≤ 2 verifier passes), with **at most 3 subagents** on it; the look-cap is hard-enforced in `verify.mjs` (verdicts are sliced to the budget) and the subagent-cap is decided in code by `route.mjs spawn` (the orchestrator threads the ledger and stops on `ok:false`). Each verifier attacks from a **dimension-appropriate lens** (`verify.mjs select` attaches it; security findings route to a `taint-verifier`). A verifier tries to *refute* the finding; majority rules; a **critical/important finding is not dropped on a single refuter** when escalation is enabled and a 2nd look is affordable (lone refutation → needs-human); any unresolved split is handed to you, not dropped. Configure under `verify` / `escalation`.

## Dimensions & agents

22 bundled agents. The four orchestration agents (`triage-classifier`, `intent-harvester`, `correctness-reviewer`, `review-synthesizer`) plus `intent-grouper`, `business-logic-analyzer`, `finding-verifier`, the two Tier C exhaustive-pass agents (`completeness-critic`, `taint-verifier`), and one specialist per dimension:

| Dim | Agent | Model |
|-----|-------|-------|
| D1/D2/D12 | correctness-reviewer | sonnet |
| D3 security | vuln-reviewer | opus |
| D4 error handling | error-handling-reviewer | sonnet |
| D5 tests | test-adequacy-reviewer | sonnet |
| D6/D8 data & resources | data-store-reviewer | sonnet · opus on migration |
| D7 concurrency | concurrency-reviewer | opus |
| D9 perf | perf-scalability-reviewer | opus |
| D10 API compat | api-compat-reviewer | sonnet |
| D11 types | type-design-reviewer | sonnet |
| D13 docs | docs-comment-reviewer | haiku |
| D14 observability | observability-reviewer | sonnet |
| D15 deps/CVE | dependency-reviewer | sonnet |
| D16 simplification | simplification-reviewer | sonnet |
| D17 a11y/i18n | a11y-i18n-reviewer | sonnet |

Each is isolated (clean packet: intent + criteria + diff, never the chat history), changed-lines-only, and confidence-gated (≥ 80).

## Configuration — `.adverserial-code-review/config.json`

Created by `/review-init`; schema at `.adverserial-code-review/config.schema.json`. Beyond `risk_map`, `mandatory_checks`, `project_rules`, `intent_sources`, and `gate`, v0.2 adds: `verify`, `escalation`, `large_diff`, `scan`, `learning`, `notify`, `worktree` (run the review in a throwaway git worktree checked out from the remote's latest base/head — so it reviews the most recent pushed code, not the local checkout; the worktree name is recorded in the report), and `trackers` (ClickUp/Jira — tickets fetched via MCP, **no API tokens**; if a tracker's MCP server isn't connected, `/review` asks you to enable it and the report states whether each tracker was used).

## Design principles

- **Portable, zero-dependency** — pure ESM `.mjs`, only Node + git required.
- **Reviewer isolation** — each agent gets a clean packet, never the chat history. *(Enforced by the orchestrator command's packet construction, not a `lib/` backstop — agent-instructed.)*
- **False-positive control** — confidence ≥ 80; adversarial verify with per-dimension lenses (security/error/data/concurrency/resources/perf/api/types/observability; generic correctness fallback for the rest); accepted-FP memory.
- **Doubt is surfaced, not hidden** — unresolved findings (and lone refutations of high-severity findings) go to a "needs human" list.
- **Changed lines only** — pre-existing issues outside the diff are not flagged. *(Agent-instructed; no taint-following across the diff boundary.)*
- **Bounded cost** — model tiering + ≤ 3 looks/subagents per aspect.

## Development

```bash
npm test             # or: node --test
```

Runs the unit suite (triage, render, shard, verify, memory, scan, comments, gather, route, worktree) **and** the CLI integration suite (`tests/cli.test.mjs` — spawns plan/verify/scan/report/memory/route/comments/preflight end-to-end). No build, no dependencies.

## Roadmap

- **Done (v0.6.0)** — **token-savings pass** (no quality loss): dimension reviewers now get a **shard-scoped diff** (`lib/trim-diff.mjs`) instead of the whole diff — the single dominant input-token cost — while D3/security and every verifier/completeness-critic keep the full diff so cross-file taint survives. The **report executor agent is gone**: `report.mjs` is now an exported `generateReport()` the `/review` command runs directly, degrading soft failures (memory, file write) to notes instead of crashing. `triage-classifier` is **skipped on the trivial tier** and no longer gets `plan.models` in its prompt; the **completeness-critic receives a digested findings list** (keeps `verdict`+`dimension`, drops the bulky `evidence`/`fix`, which still reach the synthesizer).
- **Done (v0.4.0)** — **plugin-namespaced agent dispatch**: the Workflow resolves every bundled agent through `pluginAgent()` (`adversarial-code-review:<name>`), fixing "agent type not found" on projects other than the plugin's own repo. **`triage-classifier` wired in** — a first-step judgment pass that flags a higher tier for the human and adds dimensions the rules missed as real review aspects. **`completeness-critic` wired in** — on exhaustive reviews, a false-negative guard that re-dispatches ≤6 targeted reviewers for missed dimensions/criteria/taint, whose new findings re-enter Verify. **Honest coverage report** — the "Agents & coverage" section now classifies RAN strictly by observed dispatch count, so a planned-but-never-dispatched agent no longer shows as "ran 0×".
- **Done (v0.3.1)** — **stale-base warning**: the worktree setup reports `behindBase` (commits the base has that the head hasn't integrated) and `/review` asks you to rebase/merge before reviewing, so the `base..head` diff isn't computed against a stale base (advisory — never hard-blocks).
- **Done (v0.3)** — Workflow-based `/review` (thin dispatcher; fan-out + verify-all in `lib/review-workflow.mjs`); **verify-all** (every finding on non-trivial tiers gets its own dedicated verification agent, not just uncertain ones); `lib/review-orchestration.mjs` (canonical, unit-tested pure Workflow helpers); `report.mjs` API hardened (requires `plan+agentRuns`; dropped `--out`/`--html` flags).
- **Done (v0.2)** — bounded adversarial verify (code-enforced via `verify.mjs select`/`resolve`), full 17-dimension catalog, HTML report, **git-worktree review of the remote's latest pushed code**, per-project memory, PR-comment ingestion, **MCP-based ClickUp/Jira ingestion (no API tokens)**, dependency CVE scan, large-diff sharding, intent grouping + deterministic extra-intent scrutiny & forced-check routing (`route.mjs`), aspect-budget ledger (≤3/aspect), business-logic open questions.
- **Next** — pre-push hook + GitHub Action templates; richer incremental diffing; auto-resolve memory questions from chat answers; deeper big-org parity (mutation testing, consumer-codebase impact scan, perf-benchmark execution, cross-shard dependency analysis); use Context7 MCP or web search for up-to-date library docs.
